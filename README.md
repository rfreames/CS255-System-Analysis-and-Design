Module Eight Project Review

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client for this project was DriverPass, a company focused on helping students pass their DMV driver’s test. The client requested a system that allowed students to book lessons online, review feedback from driving instructors, and take online lessons if purchased. The system also needed to include the ability to download reports for the admin team, the ability for teachers to provide their schedules and book cars to use, and the ability for the secretary to set up student profiles and book lessons for them.

•	What did you do particularly well?

One of the things I did particularly well was in designing the use case diagram. I was able to include a large variety of use cases, and by using color coding for each actor the chart was still fairly easy to read and communicated the general purpose of the system.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one area of my documents, I would likely revise the technical requirements section of the system design document. While I think I covered the general idea behind requirements, I would’ve liked to add more concrete examples such as actual cloud providers, security settings, etc.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I summarized user needs in the business requirements document, and when designing the various UML diagrams followed the document to make sure I was including the client’s requests. The entire project centers around what the users want, so it is important to always keep that at the forefront of the project. After all, without the client there is no project.

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

To design software for a client, I would follow the approach used in this project. To begin with, I would interview the client to get an understanding of the system they would like and create a list of objectives / uses as requested by the client. From there, I would create a list of functional and nonfunctional requirements. Once these items have been completed, I would then create a use case diagram, activity / sequence diagrams for the various use cases, and a class diagram. Ideally, following this strategy would let me get a thorough understanding of the system prior to doing any actual coding work, and be fairly confident that (initial) client requests are met.
